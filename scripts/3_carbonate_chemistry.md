Baseline carbonate chemistry
================

This markdown summarizes currently available carbonate chemistry,
focusing on total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)
as key parameters. These data originated from Jessica Crossâ€™s LDRD work
to capture natural variability envelopes of carbonate chemistry within
Sequim Bay, and provide valuable baseline information.

## TA vs salinity

TA generally positively correlates with salinity in coastal zones where
freshwater and saltwater mix, like Sequim Bay. Across available samples,
this relationship is strong (R2 = 0.71), indicating that for every
increase in salinity by one practical salinity unit (PSU), TA is
estimated to increase ~59 umol/kg. While this relationship clearly
varies, and does not necessarily account for seasonal or interannual
variation, it provides a handy first estimate for TA, which requires
laboratory analysis, via salinity, which is readily measured in-situ at
high resolution

## Estimated seasonality of TA

Using this relationship, we can estimate TA based on salinity. Following
salinity, estimated TA is highest in the fall and lowest during spring
and winter, with a peak in late October.
