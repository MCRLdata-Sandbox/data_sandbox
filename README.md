# Welcome to the MCRLdata Sandbox!

The **[MCRLdata pipeline](https://mcrldata.pnnl.gov/)** hosts and streams datasets collected by a wide range of environmental sensors located on the dock at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's Sequim, WA campus, home to the Marine and Coastal Research Laboratory. The MCRLdata sandbox serves to extend and expand the functionality and capability of the MCRLdata pipeline by providing:

  1) **Real-time access** to historic MCRLdata datasets
  2) **Custom visualizations and analyses** supporting cross-domain research
  3) **Simple, modular tools** for users to create their own visualization or analysis tools
  4) **Training guides** to bring new users up to speed.
